This is a practice exercise to use NodeJS and ExpressJS to create a todo app using just arrays.

We will furthur develop this to use ORM and MySQL/Postgres DB (Intentionally not using Mongo).

Also plan to add Authentication methods like JWT OAuth etc.

All of the projects which we develop on this will be in separate repositories.
